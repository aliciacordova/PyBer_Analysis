# Overview

We help Maria create a summary data frame in which we calculate the total number of students in each school, we also analyze by type, budget, reading score and math score. Then we were able to understand what is the highest performance by school, how much money goes to each school, the average score in math and reading by grade, among other analyzes. To complete this process, we needed to clean the data and make sure everything was without any error so that our analysis could be reliable.

Unfortunately, Maria received a request from the School Board to replace the 9th grade Thomas High School scores for "Math" and "Reading" with NaN. While keeping the rest of the data intact and repeat the same analysis as previously done.

## Summary

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

After we help Maria, we can summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

- In the Dictrict Summary performance the total % Overall Passing changed from 65.17% to 64.9%
- Fot Thomas High School the overall percentage changed from 90.94% to 90.63%, has decreased slighty. 
- We had to calculate the new passing percentages (for math & reading in THS) with the new total count of students.
   - Results for Thomas High School: % Passing Math changed from 93.27% to 93.18%. 
   - Results for Thomas High School: % Passing Reading changed 97.30% to 97.01 % 
- The scores by school spending, school size and school type remained the same, because we need to calculate thems with the same amount of total studend regardless their scores in math and reading.
